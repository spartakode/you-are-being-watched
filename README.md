# You Are Being Watched

I'll admit that that title seems a little over the top but I was short on time so I went with it.
Ain't nobody got time for names right? 

This project is a small browser extension that will tell you when you are visiting a site that could
is part of a company that could potentially be signing away your rights to privacy over to the
government. The idea for this project stemmed from [this
post](https://www.youbetrayedus.org/heroku/) by Fight for the future. In a nutshell, Salesforce that
owns Heroku has signed to support the CISA bill and therefore Fight for the future has decided to
leave Heroku. Now I'm not commenting on the pros and cons of CISA, but,  on the [Hackernews
Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10261397), someone [asked for a browser
extension](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10261882) that would alert her/him when on a site
that could be part of a government surveillance program. I thought, why not?

And that's what this is hoepfully going to be before it ends up in my Sideproject Graveyard
